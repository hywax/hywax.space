The production calendar is a calendar that contains information about working days and weekends in the country.
It lists public holidays, postponed weekends and other events that may affect work.

I got tired of searching for information about working days on the internet every time, so I decided to make a small script - [<span class="i-uil:github-alt"></span> production calendar](https://github.com/hywax/production-calendar).

The script generates a calendar in `ics` format, which can be imported into any calendar application.
In doing so, I have automated the process of updating the calendar so that it is always up-to-date. To do this, take advantage of
GitHub Actions, which runs once a month and updates the calendar. Yes, it's probably very frequent, but it allows
to find and fix bugs faster in case of an issue.

At the moment, calendars are available for the following countries:

| Country                                                         | Link                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| <span class="i-emojione:flag-for-russia"></span> Russia         | `https://hywax.space/ics/russia.ics`     |
| <span class="i-emojione:flag-for-kazakhstan"></span> Kazakhstan | `https://hywax.space/ics/kazakhstan.ics` |
| <span class="i-emojione:flag-for-belarus"></span> Belarus       | `https://hywax.space/ics/belarus.ics`    |
| <span class="i-emojione:flag-for-uzbekistan"></span> Uzbekistan | `https://hywax.space/ics/uzbekistan.ics` |
