# Hello, I'm Alex!

{{ $doc.description }}

I have been in the world of development for a long time. I started with such languages as Pascal, Delphi and later moved to Web development.
I work in a large ecommerce company as Frontend Tech Lead. My main development stack is Nuxt.js.
But also occasionally have to write something in PHP, GO and of course Node.

In my spare time I do Open Source web development and publish [my projects](/projects) on GitHub. Not so long ago I decided to start Open Source from scratch. That's why you won't see a lot of works from me, but in time the arsenal will fill up. In addition to development, I am fond of smart home and 3D modeling.
